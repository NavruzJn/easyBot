Exercise 1. Coin Toss Simulation.
      a) Input: n is number of trials.
      b) Output: h - is number of heads, t - is number of tails
      c) Write a procedure which simulates tossing a special coin. Probability of getting heads is

      and tails q “ 1 ´ p.
      d) Run the procedure n times and count the number of heads and number of tails? Compare
      your experimental result with the analytic result.
      e) Write 1 if you get heads and 0 if you get tails. What is the average results after n trials?
      Compare your experimental result with the analytic result.
      f) Do the part d) and e) for n “ 10, 100, 1000, 10000.
Exercise 2. Average distance between an accident and an ambulance
      a) Input: n is number of trials, L - is the length of the road;
      b) Output: average distance between an accident and an ambulance
      c) X - is the place of the accident, Y - is the place of the ambulance. X,Y have uniform
      distribution in p0, Lq.
      d) Write a procedure which simulates the place of the accident and the place of the ambulance
      and finds the distance between them.
      e) Run the procedure n times and find the average distance. Compare your experimental
      result with the analytic result.
      f) Do the part e) for n “ 10, 100, 1000, 10000.
